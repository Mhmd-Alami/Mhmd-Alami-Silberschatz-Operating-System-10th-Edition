#README

This program takes a line of integers and makes it to an array.
The array will be separated in two parts and each part will be given to separate threads to be sorted by bubble sort.
At last two sorted lists will be merged and sorted by a thread.
The result of three lists will be printed.

Example for input :

1 10 32 12 65 4 7 3 21
